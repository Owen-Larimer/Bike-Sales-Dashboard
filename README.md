# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
A look into bike sale customer information.

### Project Overview

The ultimate goal of this project was to glean insights into what kinds of people are buying bicycles. Learning what factors, such as age, gender, education etc. affect bike sales can aid firms in deciding to what groups they should prioritize marketing.

### Data Sources

Layoffs Data: The main data source used for this project was the dataset found in the "Excel_bike_sales_data.xlsx" file. It contains uncleaned information about bike sales. Each row is a single customer visit with columns regarding that customer's attributes and whether they purchased a bike. There are well over 1000 rows.

### Tools

- Excel - Loaded Dataset; Cleaned and Analyzed
 - Pivot Tables - Backbone of Interactable Dashboard

### Data Cleaning/Preparation Phase

In cleaning, we performed the following in excel:
1. Removed all duplicates.
2. Detailed columns using Find and Replace.
3. Fixed format issues with data types
4. Created an age bracket column using a nested if statement

### Table/Visualization Phase

During this phase, we used the data and pivot table feature of excel to create a number of charts and graphs to visualize each customer attribute and its effect on sales. Filters were applied to each visualization individually to allow the final dashboard to be interacted with.

### Findings
In exploring some of the dashboard's filters, we can discover that:
1. Men with only partial high school education are most likely to buy a bike if they are customers.
2. Commute distance is a great predictor of whether someone will buy a bike.
3. 

### Limitations

The main limitation of this project was

### From Here
The main goal of this project was just to push my SQL ability to its limits. It is still possible to load any of my resulting datasets into Tableau or Pandas to get some solid visualizations that represent the data, and that may be a short addition to this project in the future. However, for now, I've accomplished what I set out to do.
